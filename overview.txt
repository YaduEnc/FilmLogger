# CineLunatic - Technical Project Overview

CineLunatic is a premium, minimalist archival companion for obsessive cinema viewers. The platform allows users to log films, curate custom thematic collections, and visualize their viewing habits through detailed analytics.

## 1. Core Architecture
- **Framework**: React + Vite (TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS + Tailwind Utility Classes
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Google OAuth)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (Real-time NoSQL storage)
- **Movie Data**: TMDB API integration (Bearer Token authorization)

## 2. Key Features & Implementation Details

### A. Personal Archiving (Diary)
- **Log Entry System**: CRUD operations for logging films with date, rating, and personal notes.
- **Personal History**: Every movie detail page pulls your specific viewing history for that film.
- **Diary View**: Grouped-by-month chronological feed of your entire cinema journey.

### B. Curated Collections (Lists)
- **Watchlist**: A dedicated space for films you intend to watch, synced across devices.
- **Custom Collections**: Create named, thematic lists (e.g., "70s Neo-Noir", "Slow Cinema Favorites").
- **Collection Management**: Add/remove films from any collection with real-time Firestore array updates.

### C. Advanced Analytics (Stats)
- **Viewing Trends**: Monthly activity breakdown using Recharts bar visualizations.
- **Genre Diversity**: Interactive pie charts showing your most-watched movie categories.
- **World Cinema**: Breakdown of films by production country to track global viewing diversity.
- **Personnel Tracking**: Automatic tracking of top directors and actors in your archive.

### D. Cinematic Discovery
- **Rich Search**: Search by title with integrated genre filtering.
- **Discovery Hub**: Real-time trending and popular movie carousels.
- **Premium Detail View**: Narrative overviews, full credits, cinematic trailer overlays, and backdrop support.

### E. Social & Profile Identity
- **Branding**: Unique "CineLunatic" identity with a custom-engineered SVG logo.
- **User Bios**: Persistent personal bios and profile metadata stored in Firestore.
- **Settings Management**: Real-time profile updates that sync with both Auth and Database layers.

## 3. Key Functions (lib/db.ts & lib/tmdb.ts)

- `createLogEntry`: Persists film logs to Firestore with server-side timestamps.
- `getUserStats`: Calculates complex totals and array breakdowns on the fly.
- `toggleWatchlist` / `toggleFavorite`: Atomic toggles for collection state.
- `createCustomList` / `addMovieToList`: Multi-level collection management.
- `getMovieDetails`: Deep data fetching including "append_to_response" for credits/trailers.
- `updateUserData`: Syncs extended profile metadata like bios to the database.

## 4. Design Principles
CineLunatic adheres to "Archival Minimalism" — High-contrast typography, silver/charcoal color palettes, and a focus on data density without visual clutter. The UI is fully optimized for mobile devices with responsive grids and touch-friendly interactions.
